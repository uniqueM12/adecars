This the code base of a vehicle retail application being build with Java and other Java related frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, Thymeleaf etc. Please note that the project is not completed, just not yet, so if you find any issues you should not panic instead, you should let us know so we can improve on the code. It is also expected that the code changes frequently.
In a situation where you clone and download the project to your local machine, please do make sure you have Java 8 installed and also note that the biuld tool is maven and you should import to eclipse. Thank you.
